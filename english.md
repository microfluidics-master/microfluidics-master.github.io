The **Master in Microfluidics** (Master 2) is an **interdisciplinary program** supported by the [Institut Pierre-Gilles de Gennes (IPGG)](https://www.ipgg.fr/).  
It is oriented towards **innovation, research, and industrial applications**, and offers one of the fastest ways to connect with the **start-up ecosystem** in the field of microfluidics.

This program is part of two internationally recognized Master's degrees:

- **Physics of Complex Systems** (Sorbonne Université, Université Paris Cité, Université Paris-Saclay) – for students with a physics background.  
- **Materials Science and Engineering** (Université PSL) – for students with chemistry or biology backgrounds.

### Why join the Microfluidics program?

The program provides a **unique combination** of advanced scientific training, cutting-edge research experience, and exposure to innovation.  
Two key strengths define the student experience:

- **Excellence in academic teaching** with a highly interdisciplinary curriculum.  
- **Hands-on research & technological training**, directly linked to academic labs and industrial innovation.  

Students are trained to think like scientists and engineers while solving real-world problems. They benefit from:

- A faculty of internationally recognized experts  
- Access to state-of-the-art research platforms  
- A strong culture of innovation through collaborations with start-ups and incubators

### A unique location

Student life takes place in the **heart of Paris**, within the Latin Quarter – a historical hub of French science.  
The IPGG campus is within walking distance of world-class institutions such as:

- Sorbonne Université  
- Institut Curie  
- École Normale Supérieure  
- Chimie ParisTech  
- ESPCI Paris  

This geographical concentration fosters **constant interdisciplinary exchange**.  
Paris itself is a **thriving multicultural hub of innovation** and research, offering direct access to **Université Paris-Saclay, Université Paris Cité, and innovation clusters**.

### Curriculum Overview

The program runs from **September to June/July** and is worth **60 ECTS**.

- **Courses (30 ECTS)** → Core & specialized classes in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.  
- **Research Project (3 ECTS)** → A first-semester project in an IPGG lab.  
- **Master’s Thesis & Internship (30 ECTS)** → A 5–6 month research internship, defended before a jury.  

#### Core Topics

**Technology**  
- Micro- and nanofabrication: silicon, PDMS, plastics, flexible electronics  
- Surface functionalization (molecular & biomolecular methods)  
- Characterization: microscopy, flow cytometry, rheology, single-molecule imaging  

**Physics**  
- Hydrodynamics at the microscale, nanofluidics  
- Capillarity, wetting, soft matter & interfaces  

**Lab-on-a-chip**  
- Continuous & segmented flow chemistry  
- Bioassays & analytical microdevices  

**Biology & Biochemistry**  
- Droplet-based biochemistry & single-cell analysis  
- Single-cell & collective cell behavior in microdevices  
- Organ-on-chip approaches  

---

### Hands-on Training

From the very start, students receive **intensive lab training** on the IPGG technological platform, learning to **design, fabricate, and manipulate microfluidic devices**.  

This foundation is reinforced by:  
- A short research project in semester 1.  
- A Master’s thesis (30 ECTS) in semester 2, carried out in academia or industry, in France or abroad.

### Innovation & Industry Connection

Microfluidics is a driver of **deep-tech entrepreneurship**.  
The program benefits from strong ties with innovation clusters:  

- PC’Up incubator  
- Tremplin Carnot IPGG TT office  

Students meet start-ups and industrial partners during regular events, and many companies have directly emerged from IPGG labs.
